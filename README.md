# Simple-Code_Generator-Compiler-Design
The provided C++ code generates a simple calculator program and writes its code into a file named "calculator.cpp." This program allows you to specify the number of arithmetic operations you want to perform, and then it prompts you to enter each operation along with two operands. It then generates C++ code that performs the specified arithmetic operations and prints the results.

## Here's a brief description of how the code works:

### 1.The code includes the necessary header files for input and output operations: <iostream> and <fstream>.

### 2.The main() function is defined.

### 3.The user is prompted to input the number of operations they want to perform.

### 4.An output file stream named outfile is opened, and "calculator.cpp" is created for writing.

### 5.If the file fails to open, an error message is displayed and the program returns an error code.

### 6.The program writes the initial part of the C++ code into the output file, including the #include <iostream> and the using namespace std; lines.

### 7.A loop iterates for the specified number of operations.

### 8.Inside the loop, the program prompts the user to input an arithmetic operation in the format "number operator number" (e.g., "5 + 3").

### 9.The program writes code to the output file to print the entered operation, calculate the result based on the operator, and print the result. If an invalid operator is provided, it prints "Invalid operator."

### 10.After the loop, the program writes the closing lines of the C++ code into the output file.

### 11.The output file is closed.

### 12.A success message is displayed in the console.

## This code generates a C++ program that acts as a simple calculator and automatically generates the corresponding C++ code for performing the entered arithmetic operations. It's a creative way to demonstrate code generation based on user inputs. You can use this code snippet as an example in your GitHub repository's description to showcase your programming skills or to explain how code generation works.
